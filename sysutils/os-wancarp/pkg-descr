Automatically enables or disables a WAN interface based on CARP master/backup
state changes. Installs a CARP syshook script that reads its configuration
(interface key and trigger VHID) from the OPNsense GUI.

When this node becomes CARP MASTER the selected WAN interface is brought up
and re-configured (DHCP re-lease included). When the node drops to BACKUP the
interface is shut down so only the master node holds the upstream connection.
